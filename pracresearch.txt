Problem Statement:
       The integration of the eLMS (Educational Learning Management System) has been commonly used in institutions and academies worldwide particularly during the world-wide pandemic known as the COVID 19 Pandemic. Even today Senior Highschool students still rely on the ELMS system for learning, is is important to explore how they experience and familiarize with its interface such as usability, quick to navigate, and user experience.

The Importance of UI/UX Design in E-Learning. The Design Interface of a website is a crucial factor whether users will use a product whether it will be easy to navigate or clunky. As said by Dimah Al-Fraihat, Mike Joy, Ra'ed Masa'deh and Jane Sinclair. (2020), that e-learning websites focus on the adaptation, utilization, and its contents to maximize user satisfaction and learning effectiveness, if the design interface of an e-learning platform is difficult to navigate its interface, the student may struggle and be frustrated accessing files containing the information they seek.

 Furthermore, Santoso Harry B., and Schrepp Martin (2019) highlights that most of the concerns of the user experiences were the efficient interactions, the ease of using the product and the ease of familiarizing.  Kateryna V. Vlasenko, Lovianova Iryna V. , Volkov Sergii V., et al, (2022), cites that usability of a user interface is one of the important tasks for developers to support the student for their distance learning. These studies suggest that good UI/UX design can lead to improved student determination and motivation for learning.

The Accessibility of Digital Learning. A websites accessibility can affect the user experience of students whether it is compatible on a mobile device, laptop, and a computer.  In addition Chadli Fatima E.,  Gretete, Driss and Moumiss Anniss (2021), specified digital usability and accessibility can also mean that disabled people (PWD's) can also interact, utilize, and access these digital learning content. As with the recent pandemic disabled people had a difficult time adjusting to the new digital services that the world has switched and adapted to.

Moreover, poor usability can lead to confusion and time wasted, making it difficult for students to focus on learning. A study using a system usability scale on higher education learning Supriyadi Didi  S. Thya Safitri and Kristiyanto Daniel Yeri (2020), A university's goals are to develop an e-learning system to fulfil a more efficient and effective way of learning as the rise of information and communication technology (ICT) with its advantage to change someone's way of learning and business interactions. Hence depending how accessible and usable an e-learning system is, it can make a use feel more satisfied or confused and irritated, as such can also impact the user's dedication to learn.

E-Learning Adaptation in the Philippines, as the global pandemic hit the Philippines in March of 2020, schools were suspended and closed for a while with graduation ceremonies being either online or cancelled entirely. Despite these new setbacks more and more e-learning sites are getting used in schools and institutions, but challenges arise with others having no access to technology especially in rural areas when there's barely any signal. As highlighted by Delita Fitra (2021) as both students and teachers had experienced with lack of access, technology expertise, and internet connection.

Similarly, a study of Misamis University, teachers had a hard time motivating the students, keeping their attention, student’s engagement, and difficulty whether the students were learning anything at all Clarin Analyn S. and Baluyos Esther L. (2022). As teachers who remained during the pandemic have a good persistence of not giving up.  In addition, as the end of online classes and students have returned to face-to-face classes has its own fair share of challenges arisen such as Diana M. Javier (2022) with teachers having a hard time   managing the workload and class behavior after being used to online and modular classes. Therefor even with the significant shift in learning, students and teachers still managed to be able to teach and learn side by side though some mainly struggled with its concept.

Impact of E-Learning in the Phillipines. E-Learning has surfaced all aroudn the internet (e.g Genyo and Aralinks) with its uses to track students records and able to pass tasks and assignments in the comfort of their home. As talked with the challenges of adapting the e-learning system in the Philippines such as families with low income has a major disadvantage and risk of educational detachment and with limited access to ELMS sites and application as highlighted by Agaton Casper Boongaling and Cueto Lavinia Javier (2021).

However, even with the negatives of e-learning integration positives such as teachers expressing positivities on how it offers favorable aid to students at accessing information and knowledge to support them with their academics (Iddrisu Bariham, 2022). Hence e-learning had a significant positive impact and challenges as of today it is still occurring and e-learning has been used throughout schools and institutions changing the way of teaching (Anggun Resdasari Prasetyo, Harlina Nurtjahjanti and Lusi Nur Ardhiani, 2021).

E -Learning Overhaul Ideas, Firstly, Simplify User Interface and Navigation using a clean, intuitive design with local language support to make the eLMS easier to navigate, especially for users with varying digital literacy levels. Secondly optimize for low-bandwidth environments to develop lightweight versions of the eLMS and enable offline access to ensure usability in areas with poor internet connectivity. Thirdly providing comprehensive training and support to offer workshops, tutorials, and technical assistance to help educators and students effectively use the eLMS. Fourthly incorporate gamification and interactive elements to add badges, quizzes, and simulations to make learning more engaging and culturally relevant. Fifthly ensuring mobile compatibility by creating mobile-friendly eLMS applications to cater to the majority of Filipinos who access the internet via smartphones. Sixthly fostering collaboration and communication by integrate discussion forums, group projects, and real-time messaging to encourage interaction and communal learning, Lastly regularly update and customize content to keep course materials updated and include localized content to maintain relevance and user engagement.
